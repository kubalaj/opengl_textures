Assignment 7
TEXTURES
by Paul Kubala 

In this lab I played with simple textures to make a room with 
a chair in it. The light rotates like it should and there is
a newly modeled chair in the middle of the scene. Modifyed 
example 15 to make this assignment. Got textures from 
cgtextures.com . 

To start.

To compile type 
make

To run type
./textures

make sure to toggle textures with 't' key after
start to insure correct lighting effects.  


To remove all executables
make clean

The controls are the same of that ex 15
